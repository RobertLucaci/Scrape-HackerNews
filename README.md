# Scrape HackerNews
Hacker News is a social news website focusing on computer science and entrepreneurship and as a programmer I wake up every morning, I make myself a coffee and I usually read this website because it is a great way to stay up to date with the industry.

# Scope of the program
There are a tone of information on Hacker News and every time you refresh the website page it is a new topic, a new thing so in order for me or you to not get overwhelmed I built a tool using **Web Scraping** which will **remove all topics that have less than 100 points**, remaining just the most popular ones, maybe the most important ones.
Sounds pretty good, right!? Letâ€™s make our life easier!

# How can you run it?
You should copy the **scrapeHN.py** file into your local computer.
Open it with your Text Editor or IDE and install all the necessary libraries.
Know to scrape on Hacker News write in your terminal: 

**python3 scrapeHN.py**

The only thing you have to do know is to write the number of pages you want to scrape.
